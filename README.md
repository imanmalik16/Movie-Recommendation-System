# Movie-Recommendation-System

Libraries/features used: Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorization, IPyWidgets.

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that helps users find similar movies based on ratings from other users and what other users liked. It first uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text-based movie titles into numerical data. By utilizing n-grams, the model captures contextual relationships between words, improving the accuracy of search results. Then, real user data on movie ratings is used to find similar movies to the searched title that other users also liked, and a score was created to determine the most recommended movies.

The development process involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing machine learning techniques with Pandas. TF-IDF Vectorization was applied using Scikit-learn to convert text-based movie titles into numerical data. By utilizing n-grams, the model captures contextual relationships between words, improving the accuracy of search results. The similarity search was implemented using matrix operations and cosine similarity. Debugging and refining were critical parts of the development, ensuring that recommendations were both accurate and responsive. Additionally, working with Jupyter Notebook and interactive widgets allowed for a more approachable interface for the user to work with. Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data manipulation, extraction, and machine learning model development.
